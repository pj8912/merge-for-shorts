 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

## üèÉ Start

```shell
python app.py 
```
- Visit http://localhost:5000

## Working

- **Crop to shorts** : Upload a video and convert to shorts format `9:16` with just a click!

- **Merge two videos** : The format of the video is any movie or tv series clip at the top and random videogame or life hacks videos at the bottom. Uploaded video file sits at the top and video game at the bottom which is in the `uploads` folder - `quake_short.mp4` , where two of them are combined to form a single video file which is <= `1 minute`. If the video uploaded by the user is greater than a minute it will be reduced to a minute. The progress can be seen on the terminal.  


## Example
- Check out this [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vQst9hvQXKI) video
- `Family Guy` video at the top and `quake` video at the bottom

- Adjust the length of the output clips for either `crop` or `merge` in `app.py`. As mentioned above, the merged-videos output is within a minute. No length limit set for Crop-to-shorts feature.
