## Requirements
- This requires `python 3.9` or higher versions

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

 - Clone repo 
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/pj8912/merge-for-shorts.git
 ```
 - Create you `venv`(I use [myenv](https://github.com/pj8912/myenv))

 - Install  dependencies :  
 ```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

## üèÉ Start 

- To run the Flask application, you can use the following command:
```
python app.py 
```
- Open http://localhost:5000

## Working
- This will start the Flask development server and you can access the application by visiting `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

- The format of the video is any movie or tv series clip at the top and random videogame or life hacks videos at the bottom.

- The application allows users to upload an video file which sits at the top and video game at the bottom which is in the `uploads` folder - `quake_short.mp4` , where two of them are combined to form a single video file which is <= `1 minute`. If the video uploaded by the user is greater than a minute it will be reduced to a minute. The progress can be seen on the terminal.
